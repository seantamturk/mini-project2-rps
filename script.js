// make a function that will open a prompt box, ask "prompt will say "say R,P, or S"
//we enter one of those
// we save the return value from the prompt 
// computer picks r, p , or s
// we compare our return value to the computers value
// if we win, tally a win, if we lose tally a loss, if it is a tie tally a tie
// if we enter any other characters than R, P, or S, then we get an alert message that says "you must enter R, P, or S. It is case sensitive"
    // it kicks us back to first prompt
// when either you or the computer reaches 3 wins, an alert box ap[pears showing the wins for each player and who won. 
// the box will give the option to play again by pressing okay
